    <p style="text-align: center">Alina Mattson is finishing up her Senior year at Sewickley Academy and is looking forward to moving on to Boston University to pursue the sciences. Throughout her High School years, she has enjoyed being a leader of the tennis and softball teams, as well as house council. Outside of school, Alina enjoys going to concerts, going out with friends, and exploring the city. As she counts down the days until graduation, she is reminiscing on her High School memories and enjoying time spent with friends.</p>
    <h1 class="centered">About the Project</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center">First of all, I'd like to thank all those that participated in this project by taking the time to send
       in photos. My goal with this project was to showcase different people around the world by using two very simple yet different questions. 
      The prompts were "What is something that gives you joy?" and "What is something that overwhelms you?". These emotions are felt universally 
    and go cross cultures: everyone feels happiness and they get overwhelmed. I picked these two questions so I would have two emotions on 
  opposite sides of the spectrum. As the responses came in, I found that although there were many similarities, everyone had their own 
unique take. For joy many people stuck to what I expected, their families. However, I was intrigued by some of the images I got back. It shows that
everyone has their own definition of joy and what it means to them. The same thing goes for overwhelmed except I didn't really have an expectation
for that. Some were overwhelmed by spiders but others said they were overwhelmed by expectations they set for themselves. All in all, this collection
of photos and information goes to show how a simple question can have so many different interpretations and responses. Enjoy looking through 
the project :)</p>
